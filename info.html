                        <li><i>Blackjack</i> is a card game played with one or more decks of cards.</li>
                        <li>The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand that is worth more points than the dealer's hand, without going over <b>21 points</b>.</li>
                        <li>Cards <b>2</b> through <b>10</b> are worth their face value, while face cards (<b>Jack</b>, <b>Queen</b>, <b>King</b>) are worth <b>10 points</b> each. Aces can be worth <b>1 or 11 points</b>, depending on what's best for the player.</li>
                        <li>At the beginning of each round, the player and dealer are each dealt two cards. The player's cards are <b>face up</b>, while the dealer's first card is <b>face down</b> and the second card is <b>face up</b>.</li>
                        <li>The player can choose to "<b>hit</b>" and receive another card, or "<b>stand</b>" and keep their current hand.</li>
                        <li>If the player's hand exceeds <b>21 points</b>, they lose immediately and forfeit their bet.</li>
                        <li>If the player stands, the dealer will reveal their face-down card. If the dealer's hand is worth less than <b>17 points</b>, they must "<b>hit</b>" until they reach at least <b>17 points</b>.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer's hand exceeds <b>21 points</b>, they lose and all remaining players win.</li>
                        <li>If the dealer's hand is worth more points than the player's hand without exceeding <b>21 points</b>, the dealer wins and the player loses their bet.</li>
                        <li>If the player's hand is worth more points than the dealer's hand without exceeding <b>21 points</b>, the player wins and receives a payout equal to their bet.</li>
                        <li>If the player's hand is worth the same amount of points as the dealer's hand, it's a "<b>push</b>" and the player neither wins nor loses their bet.</li>
                        <li>There are additional options in some variations of the game, such as "<b>splitting</b>" pairs or "<b>doubling down</b>" on certain hands.</li>

                <h2>What Is The History Behind Blackjack?</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>Blackjack</i> is a card game that has its origins in several European games played in the <b>17th century.</b> The French game <b>"vingt-et-un"</b>, 
                    meaning "twenty-one", is considered to be the precursor to modern-day blackjack. Vingt-et-un was introduced to North America by 
                    French colonists and became popular among gamblers in the <b>1800s.</b> The game we know as blackjack today is believed to have originated 
                    in America in the early 1900s. To attract more players, casinos began offering a special payout to players who achieved a hand 
                    consisting of an ace of spades and a black jack (either the jack of clubs or the jack of spades). This hand became known as <b>"blackjack"</b> 
                    and the name stuck even after the special payout was discontinued. During the 20th century, blackjack continued to grow in popularity 
                    and became a staple of casinos around the world. The game's popularity has led to numerous variations, including <i>European blackjack</i>, 
                    <i>Spanish 21</i>, and <i>Double Exposure blackjack</i>. Despite these variations, the basic objective of the game remains the same: to beat the dealer 
                    by having a hand that is worth more points than the dealer's hand, without going over 21 points. While blackjack is a beloved game that 
                    continues to captivate players worldwide, it has also been the subject of controversy over the years. <b>Card counting</b>, a strategy in which 
                    players keep track of the cards that have been dealt in order to gain an advantage, is often frowned upon by casinos. Nevertheless, the 
                    game remains one of the most widely played casino games and has become a cultural icon, appearing in movies, books, and other forms of media.
